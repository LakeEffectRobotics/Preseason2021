# LER 2021 Starter

This codebase serves as a starting point for developing your own robot code

It contains enough code that with some minor configuration you should be able to get a robot driving out of the box.

There is also a subsystem for you to use with your shooter prototype, and a command that is bound to the left bumper. If you want more subsystems or commands you are free to create them.

## Structure
The code has the following structure
```
